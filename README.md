# TranslatorProject

This project is implemented by the undergraduate students: -Ilias Papathanasiou -Konstantinos Papadopoulos

For the Translators course MYY802 of the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science And Engineering course of the University of Ioannina.


The main goal of this project is to develop a robust translator using Python, designed specifically to interpret scripts written in cutePy—a custom scripting language—and convert them into assembly code compatible with the MIPS processor architecture. This conversion process aims to bridge the gap between high-level scripting in cutePy and the low-level operational requirements of MIPS-based systems, facilitating a seamless translation of scripts into executable assembly code.

<b> Testing </b>

This repository includes a suite of tests written in cutePy, designed to help you validate the functionality and accuracy of the translator. These tests cover a range of scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing of the translator's capabilities in converting cutePy scripts into MIPS assembly code.
